# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js


npx hardhat test test/AlphaOne.js
npx hardhat test test/BetaTwo.js
npx hardhat test test/Migration.js
npx hardhat test test/Staking.js

npx hardhat run scripts/deployTokens.js
npx hardhat run scripts/migration.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deployStaking.js
```
